To use p2pool, you must be running your own local bitcoind. p2pool connects to
this bitcoin over both its p2p interface and its RPC interface. For standard
configurations, using p2p should be as simple as:

    python run_p2pool.py <rpc_username> <rpc_password>

Then run your miner program, connecting to 127.0.0.1 on port 9332 with any
username and password.


If you are behind a NAT, it will help to enable TCP port forwarding on your
router. Forward port 9333 to the host running p2pool.py.


Use

    python run_p2pool.py --help

for additional options.
