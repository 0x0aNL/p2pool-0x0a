To use p2pool, you must be running your own local bitcoind. p2pool connects to
this bitcoin over both its p2p interface and its RPC interface. For standard
configurations, using p2p should be as simple as:

    python main.py <rpc_username> <rpc_password>

Then run your miner program, connecting to 127.0.0.1 on port 8338 with any
username and password.


If you are behind a NAT, it will help to enable UDP port forwarding on your
router. Forward any random port to the host running p2pool.py and then use:

    python main.py -p <PORT> <rpc_username> <rpc_password>


Use

    python main.py --help

for additional options.
